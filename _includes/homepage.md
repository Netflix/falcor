### Things to check out in the current site draft:

There are some syntax highlighting examples on the getting started page.

I'm also experimenting with light animation to make a user's first visit really pop. [Here's a quick sketch of one idea]({{ site.baseurl }}/?animated) (or [Go back to no animations]({{ site.baseurl }}/))

I plan to make the menus pretty similar to the ones on the main netflix web ui, as I think that would fit well with the site (as well as add brand-wide visual similarity).

{% include something.html %}
