/**
 * Figures out what paths in requested pathsets can be
 * deduped based on existing optimized path tree provided.
 *
 * ## no deduping possible:
 *
 * if no existing requested sub tree at all for path,
 * just add the entire path to complement.
 *
 * ## fully deduped:
 *
 * if required path is a complete subset of given sub tree,
 * just add the entire path to intersection
 *
 * ## partial deduping:
 *
 * if some part of path, when ranges are expanded, is a subset
 * of given sub tree, then add only that part to intersection,
 * and all other parts of this path to complement
 *
 * To keep `depth` argument be a valid index for optimized path (`oPath`),
 * either requested or optimized path is sent in pre-initialized with
 * some items so that their remaining length matches exactly, keeping
 * remaining ranges in those pathsets 1:1 in correspondence
 *
 * Note that positive `depthDiff` value means that requested path is
 * longer than optimized path, and we need to pre-initialize current
 * requested path with that many offset items, so that their remaining
 * length matches. Similarly, negative `depthDiff` value means that
 * optimized path is longer, and we pre-initialize optimized path with
 * those many items. Note that because of the way requested and
 * optimized paths are accumulated from what user requested in model.get
 * (see onMissing.js), it is not possible for the pre-initialized paths
 * to have any ranges in them.
 *
 * `intersectionData` is:
 * [ requestedIntersection, optimizedComplement, requestedComplement ]
 * where `requestedIntersection` is matched requested paths that can be
 * deduped, `optimizedComplement` is missing optimized paths, and
 * `requestedComplement` is requested counterparts of those missing
 * optimized paths

/**
 * Recursive function to calculate intersection and complement paths in 2 given
 * pathsets at a given depth
 * Parameters:
 *  - `requestedPath`: full requested path (can include ranges)
 *  - `optimizedPath`: corresponding optimized path (can include ranges)
 *  - `currentTree`: path map for in-flight request, against which to dedupe
 *  - `depth`: index of optimized path that we are trying to match with `currentTree`
 *  - `rCurrentPath`: current accumulated requested path by previous recursive
 *                    iterations. Could also have been pre-initialized as stated
 *                    above.
 *                    This path cannot contain ranges, instead contains a key
 *                    from the range, representing one of the individual paths
 *                    in `requestedPath` pathset
 *  - `oCurrentPath`: corresponding accumulated optimized path, to be matched
 *                    with `currentTree`. Could have been pre-initialized.
 *                    Cannot contain ranges, instead contains a key from the
 *                    range at given `depth` in `optimizedPath`
 *  - `depthDiff`: difference in length between `requestedPath` and `optimizedPath`
 *
 *  Example scenario:
 *      - requestedPath: ['lolomo', 0, 0, 'tags', { from: 0, to: 2 }]
 *      - optimizedPath: ['videosById', 11, 'tags', { from: 0, to: 2 }]
 *      - currentTree: { videosById: 11: { tags: { 0: null, 1: null }}}
 *      // since requested path is longer, optimized path index starts from depth 0
 *      // and accumulated requested path starts pre-initialized (rCurrentPath)
 *      - depth: 0
 *      - rCurrentPath: ['lolomo']
 *      - oCurrentPath: []
 *      - depthDiff: 1
