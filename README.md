Falcor Website
==============

To Develop the Site
-------------------

1. Clone the repo
2. Install jekyll: `gem install jekyll`
3. Install required node modules: `npm install`.
4. Install gulp globally with `npm install -g gulp`.
5. Run `gulp serve` and wait for the build to finish and pop up a page

Then change any files you like and it will notify you, autorebuild, and refresh as necessary.


Configuring the Navigation
--------------------------

Please see the documented code in `_data/navigation.yml` to configure the main top nav.


In-Page Table of Contents
-------------------------

Nicer autogenerated tables of contents are coming soon!

TODO list
-----------------------------

- Proper docs integration
- Consider approaches to slim down TOC
- Style TOC
- find/make better syntax highlighting theme
- force code snippets to scroll instead of text wrapping
- add open graph metadata to base template
- verify social sharing metadata is set up and results in clean share visuals
- implement cookie for intro animation and don't show again after first play
- more docs, of course!
