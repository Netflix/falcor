Falcor Website
==============

To Develop the Site
-------------------

1. Clone the repo
2. Install jekyll: `gem install jekyll`
3. Install required node modules: `npm install`.
4. Install gulp globally with `npm install -g gulp`.
5. Run `gulp serve` and wait for the build to finish and pop up a page

Then change any files you like and it will notify you, autorebuild, and refresh as necessary.


Configuring the Navigation
--------------------------

Please see the documented code in `_data/navigation.yml` to configure the main top nav.

Nicer autogenerated tables of contents are coming soon!
